# Introduction

**Background and Motivation**

- Aronia berries contain antioxidants and bioactive substances that may prevent chronic illnesses.
- Due to its astringent flavor and poor consumer awareness, Aronia is misused despite its health benefits.
- Jam is a tasty, nutritious way to get Aronia into the diet

**Objective**

- This study aims to optimize a jam recipe using aronia berries to achieve the best predicted sensory scores through sensory evaluation

# Method

**Jam Making and Quality Control**

- The USDA blackberry jam recipe was modified by using Aronia berries and standardizing with 81.754g pectin to each batch
- Fully ripe berries were washed, pureed, then boiled with pectin and sugar.  After skimming foam, water-bath canned the hot jam in sterilized jars.
 
**Quality Checks**

- Digital refractometer measured sugar concentration with Brix reading
- A calibrated digital pH meter was used to measure pH after cooking for safety purpose

```

- The experiment employed 12 Aronia jam formulations with different concentrations of Aronia and Sugar (in grams)

# Exploratory Data Analysis

![*Histogram*](000010.png)
- Almost all attributes follow the bell shaped curves
---

# EDA (Cont.)

![*Boxplot*](000012.png){width=80% height=160px}

- Median score is 5 across all sensory attributes.
- Flavor and Texture show the most variation (higher upper quartiles).
- Aftertaste, Sweetness, and Overall have lower IQR

---

# Model Structure

RSM is a statistical technique used to model and optimize complex relationships between ingredients and sensory responses using polynomial regression

\scriptsize
The second-order polynomial (RSM) model form:
$$
\text{Score} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 A + \beta_2 A^2 + \beta_3 S + \beta_4 S^2 + \beta_5 AS + \beta_6 AS^2 + \beta_7 A^2S + \beta_8 A^2S^2 + \varepsilon
$$

Where:  
- $A$ = Aronia level (grams), $S$ = Sugar level (grams) 
- $\beta_0, \dots, \beta_8$ = Coefficient values  
- $\text{Score}$ = predicted rating (1–9 scale) 
- $\varepsilon$ = random error term. $\varepsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$ 

- Tried multiple models: first-order RSM, second-order, mixed models, and multinomial logistic regression.
- Second-order polynomial regression performed best across attributes.
- Final models included linear, quadratic, and interaction terms for Aronia and Sugar.
- To model each characteristic as a response variable, the dataset was reshaped from long to wide

# Assumption Checking

- The residuals vs. fitted plots show that residuals are evenly scattered around the horizontal reference line, indicating no major violations of linearity or unequal variance

![*residuals vs. fitted plots*](000025.png){width=80% height=200px}

# Assumption Checking (Cont.)

- Residual histograms are normal
- The residuals' bell-shaped distributions around zero show a normal distribution, as expected under linear regression.

![*Histogram*](000024.png){width=80% height=200px}


# Assumption Checking (Cont.)

- Normality assumption mostly holds
- Flavor, Texture & Aftertaste: residuals mostly normal.
- Sweetness: slight deviation from normality.

![*Q-Q Plot*](00003a.png){width=80% height=200px}

# Result

![*Mean Sensory Score*](mean_sensory.png){width=80% height=160px}

- Recipe 10 scored highest for Flavor (6.05) and Overall (5.56).
- Recipe 2 performed well in Flavor and Overall, while Recipe 3 scored lower in Sweetness and Aftertaste.
- Moderate-to-high Sugar and Aronia levels yielded better sensory outcomes


# Result (ANOVA)

\scriptsize
- Aronia significantly influenced all attributes — especially strong for Sweetness (*p* < 0.001).
- Sugar showed significant quadratic effects on Flavor and Overall, suggesting its impact is nonlinear.
- Most Aronia–Sugar interactions were insignificant, except Aronia²:Sugar, which affected Aftertaste.
- Aronia is the key driver of sensory attributes; Sugar provides secondary, curved influence.

# Result - Estimated Polynomial Model

The following second-order polynomial model was fitted for the **Flavor** attribute to capture linear, quadratic, and interaction effects of Aronia ($A$) and Sugar ($S$) levels:

\tiny

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Score(Flavor)} =\ & -699.5 + 0.6859A - 0.0001648A^2 + 0.8379S - 0.0002429S^2 \\
& - 0.0008156AS + 0.0000002367AS^2 + 0.0000001961A^2S - 0.00000005705A^2S^2 + \varepsilon
\end{aligned}
$$

\normalsize

- **Aronia and Sugar** both contribute positively to flavor up to a point
- **Quadratic terms** indicate diminishing returns at higher levels (non-linearity)
- **Interaction effects** are small but included for completeness
- Similar models were fitted for Texture, Sweetness, Aftertaste, and Overall (see Appendix)


# Optimization Results

![*Optimal Level*](optimal.png){width=80%}

- Predicted scores range from 5.20 to 6.07, with associated standard errors (SE) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).
- Overall liking is highest at 1719g Aronia and 1480g Sugar, predicting a score of 6.07.
- Sweetness was maximized at 2268g Aronia, indicating preferences vary by attribute.

# Conclusion

- Aronia and Sugar levels significantly influence the sensory attributes of jam.
- Second-order polynomial regression captured both linear and interaction effects.
- Aronia showed a consistently strong and significant effect across all attributes.
- Sugar played a more subtle role, with significant quadratic and interaction terms.
- Optimization revealed that Flavor and Overall scores peaked around:
  - **1719g Aronia**  
  - **1480–1720g Sugar**

---

# Recommendation

- Use moderate-to-high levels of both Aronia (around 1719g) and Sugar (around 1480g) to maximize overall consumer liking.

- Avoid extremely high levels of either ingredient, as quadratic effects indicate diminishing returns and possible declines in scores (especially for flavor and sweetness).

- Tailor formulation based on desired attribute:
  - For sweeter taste → increase **Sugar** (up to ~1794g).
  - For stronger aftertaste → slightly increase **Aronia** (up to ~2024g).
